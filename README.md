## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS transitions
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - Icon framework

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about email validation and the role regular expressions play in it. In addition, I used knowledge I gained from taking Javascript courses over the past few months to create a working project using more than just HTML and CSS. When I looked at the Ping project a few months ago I didn't even know where to begin in writing Javascript, so being able to complete this without looking at a tutorial was a huge feat for me.


### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn vanilla Javascript before moving on to a framework and to be able to write the same code with less lines. I'm also interested in understanding how regex works, as I am unable to explain what the pattern I used for the email form does in words.

### Useful resources

- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - This helped me in finding icons without going through numerous icon libraries and cherry picking which ones looked the best by hosting numerous icon sets in one framework.
- [Frontend Masters Web Development Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/) - This is an amazing course which helped me to understand the basics of Javascript and cement my knowledge of HTML and CSS in preparation for moving on to the Javascript projects on Frontend Mentor.
